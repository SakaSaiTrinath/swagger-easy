## Swagger Easy

### What is Swagger

[Swagger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swagger_(software) is an open-source software framework backed by a large ecosystem of tools that helps developers design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services.

### How it is good?

It is the best tool that solves many headache problems one faces in developing APIs. The best it solves is to make documentation for APIs. The way swagger UI provides, gives a 360-degree view of an API.

### What is the problem?

Swagger makes it possible by defining APIs in YAML format or JSON format. It's all good when one gets familiar with the available options to define API. Till then, one has to go through the docs. Many times, we don't know many options that are available. So, it takes time to make APIs.

### What can we do?

We can

-   address this issue
-   improve Swagger
-   make it more beginner-friendly
-   speed up the API documentation

All the above can be done by creating a user interface to make documentation by clicks and filling up forms. We can improvise it further by providing pre-defined APIs for common usages which make documentation faster. Further, we can provide recommendations, best practices, and intelligent guesses while users interacting with the user interface.

You can get the latest work done in [victoria](https://github.com/SakaSaiTrinath/swagger-easy/tree/victoria) branch. It is still under development which has not got the base structure but you can get some idea.
